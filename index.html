    <h1> Fast version control software </h1>
    <p>
      Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br>
      Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.<br>It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
      and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
